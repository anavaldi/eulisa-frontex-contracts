Section IV: Procedure
IV.1)Description
IV.1.1)Type of procedure
Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition in the Official Journal of the European Union in the cases listed below

    Extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable for the contracting authority and in accordance with the strict conditions stated in the directive

Explanation:

Electricity services are essential within the Agency’s core mission to ensure an effective, secure and continuous operation of its entrusted IT systems. Previous contract for the same nature of services expired on the 31.7.2019.

A new contract was deemed necessary to cover needs connected to:

(i) new interim/temporary building in Strasbourg;

(ii) 2nd extension in Strasbourg; and

(iii) current site.

The agency re-engaged in an internal procurement procedure initiated back in 2015 and halted in March 2016 when envisaging to address the new market conditions expected as of 1.1.2016; this had entailed several specific legal and administrative issues and uncertainties had been risen, delaying a clear definition of pending technical specifications, needs and conditions.

Alongside, ongoing construction contract for the new building had not been finished back to 2018 and exact technical specifications could not have been prepared yet.

In other words, due to the complexity of the file and in this new market configuration a new procurement procedure with the publication of contract notice could not be launched in 2018.

Section IV: Procedure
IV.1)Description
IV.1.1)Type of procedure
Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition in the Official Journal of the European Union in the cases listed below

    New works/services, constituting a repetition of existing works/services and ordered in accordance with the strict conditions stated in the directive

Explanation:

Since eu-LISA took up its core tasks in 2012, its mandate and responsibilities have been steadily growing together with its importance and visibility. At the beginning of the current framework contract in 2014 its main purpose was to cover a limited number of meetings of the Agency's governing bodies, training activities, visibility events and other strategically important meetings echoing the need of the Agency in start-up phase. However, the Agency has matured over the past years and the amount of the events and meetings, following the stakeholder's expectations, as well reflecting changes deriving from policy, legal and factual developments with new tasks arriving has amounted in a significant increase of the events and meetings to be organised as well as related budget. On request from the Agency's stakeholders, the training portfolio has significantly increased over the past years resulting in more training activities as well as raising costs. Moreover, a large number of additional meetings have emerged.

The strict conditions of Articles 134(1)(e) and 134(4) of the RAP have both been fulfilled: 1) the new services constitute a repetition of existing services entrusted to the economic operator to which the contracting authority awarded an original contract; 2) these services are in conformity with a basic project indicating the extent of possible new services and the conditions under which they would have been awarded. Both conditions above being fulfilled it was decided to start the negotiation with the incumbent contractor (lot 2 — event and travel management) in order to increase the maximum ceiling of the framework contract.

Section IV: Procedure
IV.1)Description
IV.1.1)Type of procedure
Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition in the Official Journal of the European Union in the cases listed below

    Extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable for the contracting authority and in accordance with the strict conditions stated in the directive

Explanation:

The conditions, stipulated in Art. 11.1 (c) of Annex I to EU Financial Regulation, were cumulatively fulfilled.

The extreme urgency, brought about by unforeseeable events, is not attributable to the contracting authority. The contracting authority made all possible efforts and took all necessary steps and measures in order to assure the timely continuation of the provision of insurance services for the operational site in Strasbourg, France. Since multiple calls for tenders failed, it may not be responsible for a particular situation in the market, regarding the specificity of the operational site, and furthermore, may not control it. Likewise, it may as well be suggested that the contracting authority acted with due diligence and exhausted all the means and measures, available to it, for acquiring the necessary services of insurance. After multiple unsuccessful calls for tenders, available measures at disposal had to be adopted for securing insurance services for operational site due to its strategic importance and exposure to greater risks.

The negative effects on the market by the launch of this negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice are avoided by strictly respecting the principle of proportionality, which is ensured in the following manner:

— the Agency aims to satisfy only immediate and basic needs of insurance, regarding its operational site. The objective is to acquire the most necessary insurance services, in order to avoid huge financial losses, in case of any accident or event, and to sustain the gap until a stable solution is implemented. It is important to note that this call for tenders does not intend to cover insurance intermediary services or any other additional services or insurance coverage which are not vital to the functioning of the Agency. To this end, the needs of the Agency are considered to be immediate and proportional,

— duration of the foreseen contract is proportional to the satisfaction of the most immediate and basic needs. Envisaged duration of the contract is necessary to complete a new open call for tenders,

— To ensure the competition, more than one economic operator were invited to submit the offers.

Section IV: Procedure
IV.1)Description
IV.1.1)Type of procedure
Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition in the Official Journal of the European Union in the cases listed below

    New works/services, constituting a repetition of existing works/services and ordered in accordance with the strict conditions stated in the directive

Explanation:

— these new services have become necessary due to either finalisation of the Implementing Acts or Regulation of other systems (Adaptation to Interoperability).

A justification is possible under this clause as the scope of the original SIS II MWO FWC was also the creation of a SIS II system that interacts with other systems.

Furthermore, the Framework Contract LISA/2017/RP/01 included the prediction for evolutions, thus, the extra services can be considered either as new evolutions or as extension of similar services foreseen already in the scope of the original FWC as evolutive maintenance, thus is in conformity with a basic project (or rather programme, given its intrinsic complexity and ramification) for which the original Framework Contract LISA/2017/RP/01was awarded.

— the option for the ceiling increase through this Negotiated Procedure was included in the procurement documents of the original Restricted Procedure launched in 2017, ref. LISA/2017/RP/01. See Guide for candidates of the procedure LISA/2017/RP/01 SIS II.

It is to be noted that in the Guide for candidates Art 134.1 (e) RAP to FR was foreseen, as that was the applicable rule at the time of launch of the call for tenders in 2017. In between the new Financial Regulation(Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, repealing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (2012 Financial Regulation) entered into force with Section 11.1 replacing the previous Art 134.1 e of the RAP.

— the FWC LISA/2017/RP/01 was signed on 1 June 2018, any such Negotiated Procedure (LISA-2021-NP-07) is concluded within the third year following the contract signature in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, applicable by virtue of Article 89 of Financial Rules of the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA), adopted by the Management Board Decision No 198/2019 rev 1 of 28 August 2019.

Section IV: Procedure
IV.1)Description
IV.1.1)Type of procedure
Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition in the Official Journal of the European Union in the cases listed below

    Extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable for the contracting authority and in accordance with the strict conditions stated in the directive

Explanation:

1) Immediate needs of the Agency, regarding face masks, must be accommodated without any delay. When estimating the immediate needs, the following factors are taken into consideration: situation and volatility of the market, necessity to protect health and safety of the personnel of the Agency, acquisition of the most necessary and urgent supplies (face masks), until more stable solutions are implemented, impossibility to use other procedures under time and other constraints.

2) Extreme urgency has been brought by an unforeseeable event — Covid-19 outbreak and pandemic. This event and especially its specific developments, which happened at an unprecedented rate, are considered as unforeseeable by EU-LISA. The specific needs of face masks, as part of the strategy for prevention and control measures against the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Agency, certainly, could not be foreseen and planned in advance. Therefore, the existence of an unforeseeable event is justified.

3) The extreme urgency of the purchase is under no circumstances attributable to EU-LISA. First of all, since the declaration of the emergency states and imposition of the restrictive measures,including confinement, by French and Estonian authorities, there was a constant uncertainty about possible future developments and prospects of deconfinement, even in a very short term. Furthermore, it has to be added, that the usage of masks was debatable and questionable in the beginning of the outbreak of Covid-19. Initially, it was not considered as a necessary precautionary measure amongst the healthy individuals.

In this respect EU-LISA had closely followed the strategies and recommendations, adopted by respective authorities and states and acted in due diligence to contribute to the containment of the virus.

Nonetheless, as soon as the positive effects of carrying face masks as a prevention against the spread and transmission of the virus along with recommendations of respective health authorities came into picture, with a view of the possibility of gradual de-confinement measures, announced by the states, the Agency developed recommendations on the use of masks. The procurement of masks is based on these recommendations.

IV.1.1)Type of procedure
Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition in the Official Journal of the European Union in the cases listed below

    No tenders or no suitable tenders/requests to participate in response to open procedure

Explanation:

In April 2019, eu-LISA launched the open procedure for the provision of external assistance (Ref. LISA/2019/OP/02, ICT and administrative external support) divided in 4 lots. Only one (1) tender was received in response to the call for tenders lot 2 (ICT Support for the eu-LISA HQ in Tallinn). Considering both legal and procedural requirements for establishing the multiple framework contract with reopening of competition, envisaged as a result of the procedure, it was decided to cancel the procedure. More specifically, both legal, procedural and contractual requirements could not be fulfilled, namely with a view to Point 1.4 of Annex I of the Financial Regulation – Procurement A multiple framework contract with reopening of competition shall be concluded with at least three economic operators, provided that there is a sufficient number of admissible tenders [..]).
