Section IV: Procedure
IV.1)Type of procedure
IV.1.1)Type of procedure
Negotiated without a call for competition
Justification for the award of the contract without prior publication of a contract notice in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU):
Directive 2004/18/EC

1) Justification for the choice of the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice in the OJEU in accordance with Directive 2004/18/EC
The works/goods/services can be provided only by a particular tenderer for reasons that are:
technical
A switch to another GIS technology is extremely difficult due to: extensive usage of ESRI technology as the GIS foundation in our systems; complexity of the core GIS service infrastructure; uppermost importance for the contracting authority and its partners of products like reports and analyses which are GIS-related and cannot be produced without GIS support; lack on the market of any competitive software which could be capable of replacing the existing GIS solutions in Frontex by any other GIS solution with comparable capabilities. Thus, a competitive procedure will not take place for technical reasons.

Explanation:

Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition in the Official Journal of the European Union in the cases listed below:

Explanation:

The undertaken amendment to the original contract referred to additional supplies and services by the original contractor which were not included in the original procurement on the basis of the following conditions:

1. a change of the contractor cannot be made because the requested module will constitute an integral part of the entire solution, will use common features of the already contracted solution and shall be designed with in-depth integration on the concept and technical layers;

2. any potential change of the contractor would cause substantial duplication of costs for the contracting authority because of the need for additional integration works and cost of licences for features already available in the contracted solution which will be reused;

3. the increase in the price, including the net cumulative value of successive modifications, does not exceed 50 % of the initial contract value.

Section IV: Procedure
IV.1)Description
IV.1.1)Type of procedure
Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition in the Official Journal of the European Union in the cases listed below

    The works, supplies or services can be provided only by a particular economic operator for the following reason:
        protection of exclusive rights, including intellectual property rights

Explanation:

Since the very beginning of Frontex the risk analysis is one of the key operational activity which constitute a basis for other activities. Tasks related to risk analysis, to be performed by Frontex, were defined in the first Frontex Regulation (EC) 2007/2004. In the new Frontex Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 the tasks related to risk analysis are even extended in comparison to the previous state. Frontex organizational structure has been recently changed and Situational Awareness and Monitoring Division has been created in order to fulfill the new requirements.

The role of SAS Software and its importance for risk analysis process in Frontex

SAS technology is the tool which supports risk analysis tasks in Frontex. The first implementation of SAS technology took place in 2008. Since 2008 Frontex has invested a significant amount of resources in terms of time, human resources and financial means for:

— SAS Software licenses and its integration to Frontex architecture,

— Specific hardware in order to meet the requirements of the SAS Software utilized,

— Trainings and workshops which were conducted to facilitate Frontex staff to acquire the appropriate knowledge. There is now a substantial body of knowledge established in Frontex based on the SAS technology.

Nowadays SAS technology is one of the core and critical component of risk analysis process.

Potential replacement of SAS technology for an equivalent technology would require a strategic decision in order to initiate a process which will last several years and would require significant financial and non-financial investments in order to reach a level of maturity similar to the current one. During this period the solutions based on SAS technology would require at least to be maintained.

SAS Institute and its market position.

SAS Institute Inc. is the sole manufacturer and publisher of SAS Software. SAS Institute Inc. is the owner of the intellectual property rights in SAS Software.

The European border surveillance system (Eurosur) was established by the Regulation (EU) Nº 1052/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22.10.2013 establishing the European Border Surveillance System (Eurosur) to support secure exchange of border-related information including irregular migration and cross-border crime among the corresponding national coordination centres of participating Member States and between the national coordination centres and Frontex.

Eurosur communication network (ECN) enables secure exchange of Eurosur information. It is implemented as a Web-based, GIS-intensive, distributed, extensible information exchange system based on Java and OSS technologies and using a set of secure peer-to-peer Internet connections for data exchange.

Eurosur communication network is currently composed of 31 nodes, each with their corresponding hardware and software, including a local copy of the information database. Additional nodes are deployed for staging and disaster recovery purposes in Frontex headquarters and in the backup data centre.

The Eurosur technical management system, providing master services, distribution of centrally served map services and support to the Eurosur communication network and its nodes, is an integral part of the ECN.

The maintenance and support of ECN as well as its evolution are objectives of this framework. Evolution of the network should be understood as the activities including, but not limited to, design, development, implementation and deployment of the new functionalities and the underlying infrastructure.

Additionally Frontex might request services needed to extend the ECN ecosystem by developing new categories of information sources, developing or extending applications and solutions that provide or consume Eurosur information or to introduce any kind of integration with external systems and applications.

More specifically, the Framework Contract shall cover the following main areas:

a) Eurosur evolution:

— extension of the Eurosur communication network to new nodes to encompass additional current and future Member States, Schengen associated countries and selected EU agencies,

— improving system stability and reliability of Eurosur nodes and applications suite,

— extending Eurosur nodes accessibility by local users and systems,

— development of Eurosur training environments,

— enhancement of the Eurosur application,

— enhancement and rationalisation of Eurosur infrastructure.

b. Eurosur support and maintenance:

— daily operation of Eurosur network,

— maintenance and support of the Eurosur network including hardware maintenance,

— maintenance and support of the application suite.

    The works, supplies or services can be provided only by a particular economic operator for the following reason:
        absence of competition for technical reasons

Explanation:

The service, which is the subject of the current procurement allows to detect emissions of electromagnetic waves (radio frequencies) coming from maritime radars, AIS transponders, satellite phones and potentially other sources by spaceborne assets and to geo-locate them. The conducted market research clearly states that currently there is only one company that is capable of delivering the desired services (HawkEye360). Two other companies which are in the same market (Unseenlabs, Kleos Space) are still in the initial stage of ramping up, i.e. satellites deployment and will reach full operational capabilities in the mid-term future only.

With the use of accelerated open tender procedure it hopefully will be possible to start the necessary aerial surveillance service deployments much sooner than with applying a regular procedure.
